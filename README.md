## Introduction

The **3D Editor** project aims to create an intuitive interface for editing 3D shapes. Users can manipulate objects using hand gestures, making the experience more engaging and accessible. This project leverages cutting-edge technology in augmented reality and computer vision to bring a unique editing experience to the web.

## Features

- **Natural Hand Gestures**: Control 3D shapes using simple hand movements.
- **Interactive UI**: A user-friendly interface that makes editing straightforward.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate visual feedback as you manipulate shapes.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on various devices with a compatible web browser.
- **Open Source**: Feel free to contribute and enhance the project.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes several powerful technologies:

- **three.js**: A JavaScript library that simplifies the creation of 3D graphics.
- **WebGL**: A web standard for rendering 2D and 3D graphics in the browser.
- **MediaPipe**: A framework for building multimodal applied machine learning pipelines, used here for hand tracking.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the web application.
- **JavaScript**: The primary programming language for the application logic.

## Getting Started

To get started with the **3D Editor**, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SHOEAB11/3D-editor.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd 3D-editor
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   If you are using npm, run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   Open `index.html` in your web browser to start using the editor.

## Usage

Once you have the application running, you can start editing 3D shapes:

1. **Select a Shape**: Use the UI to choose a 3D shape to edit.
2. **Use Hand Gestures**: Move your hands in front of the camera to manipulate the shape.
   - **Pinch to Scale**: Bring your fingers together to scale the shape down, or move them apart to scale it up.
   - **Swipe to Rotate**: Move your hand left or right to rotate the shape.
   - **Lift to Move**: Raise your hand to lift the shape up or lower it down.

3. **Save Your Work**: After editing, you can save your design through the UI.
